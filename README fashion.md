Fashion MNIST CNN Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras. The code is provided in both Python and R.

Project Structure
fashion_mnist_cnn.py: Python script for the CNN implementation.
fashion_mnist_cnn.R: R script for the CNN implementation.
README.md: This file, containing instructions on how to set up and run the scripts.

Prerequisites
Python
Python 3.12.4
TensorFlow and Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
To install the required Python packages, run:

R
R 4.2.3
Keras package

Ensure that all required packages are installed. Y

Run the script:

Execute the Python script from the command line:
python fashion_mnist_cnn.py
Output:

The script will train the CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset and output the predicted classes for two sample images from the test set.

Running the R Script
Set up the environment:

Ensure that the Keras package is installed in R. Use the install.packages("keras") command if needed.

Run the script:

Execute the R script from within an R environment:
Output:

The script will train the CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset and print the predicted classes for two sample images from the test set.

Interpreting the Output
The output for both scripts will display the predicted class indices for two images. The classes correspond to the following items in the Fashion MNIST dataset:

0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot
The predictions will be integers ranging from 0 to 9, corresponding to the item categories listed above.

Additional Information
The CNN model consists of six layers, including convolutional, max pooling, flatten, and dense layers.
The model is trained for 10 epochs with a validation split in both Python and R implementations.

Troubleshooting
Ensure that the dataset is correctly loaded and the images are preprocessed (normalized) before training.
If you encounter any issues, check that all packages are up to date and compatible with your Python or R version.
